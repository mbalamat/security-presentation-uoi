HTTP is not secure
------------------

- Introduction to HTTP
    - HTTP was designed back when there was no need for encryption
    - Everything uses HTTP
    - (demo) Show Wiresharkâ€”everything is plaintext
- (demo) Marios goes on a (possibly known like Facebook) website via HTTP and logs in while Kostis is MitMing him. Marios logs in with his password and I sniff it.
    - What just happened? We'll show that we can sniff easily all HTTP traffic and alter it to our liking.
- Introduction to HTTPS
    - HTTP solves the problem of HTTP being plaintext
    - Unfortunately it's not as widely adopted as we'd like
    - Demonstrate that Facebook, Twitter, Gmail all use HTTPS
- (demo) Marios normally logs in to Cronos and I sniff his password.
    - Anyone can create an HTTPS certificate!
    - HTTPS is useless if we get a warning and ignore it. The communication is encrypted but we don't know who we are communicating with.
    - Example of a bad deployed certificate: webmail.cs.uoi.gr. C'mon guys.
- (demo) Marios works on his laptop and downloads some software (eg. VLC).
    - He doesn't verify the authenticity of the software he just downloaded and runs it. The VLC binary he's running has been altered by Kostis.
- Ways to defend:
    - HTTPS: Good examples are Chrome, Firefox, etc.
    - Checksums
    - Briefly: GPG
- Further: Anyone can host a valid HTTPS site, should you trust any HTTPS site to download and run software from? NO!
